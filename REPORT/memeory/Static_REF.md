## Leak #1: Static List of Activities

This leak is caused by adding every `MainActivity` instance to a static `MutableList` on creation. Since the static list is never cleared, 
it holds a reference to every activity created during screen rotations, preventing them from being garbage collected.

## Leak #2: Static Reference to a View

This leak is caused by assigning a `TextView` instance to a static `View` variable. Because the `View` holds a reference to the `Context` (the `Activity`) it was created in, holding onto the `View` implicitly holds onto the entire `Activity`.

# Solution 1 (NULLIFY those static refernce)

```java
override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        leakedView = NULL
        Log.d("LeakTest", "MainActivity onDestroy() called. Instance and View both remain in memory.")
    }
```

# Solution 2
```java
companion object {
        // SOLUTION: Use WeakReference to hold references without preventing garbage collection.
        val activityInstances = mutableListOf<WeakReference<MainActivity>>()
        var viewInstance: WeakReference<View>? = null
}
```
- This deletes the activity on destrying th activity.

### Bitmaps
- Bitmaps are used whenever you want to draw images on the screen, manipulate images, or perform graphics operations.
- A Bitmap is essentially a map of pixels â€” it represents an image in memory.
- Their size os too large.
